> The project is still not on a stable release, I wouldn't recommend running the bridge yet.

Distodon is a one-way bridge that reads messages incoming from a Discord server and publishes them onto Mastodon.

The more specific functioning is:

You set up a channel, and the bot reads each message from that channel. It then parses it as an image and then posts it onto the provided Mastodon account.
